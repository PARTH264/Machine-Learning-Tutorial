# Machine Learning Tutorial

Welcome to the repository for my individual assignment on machine learning! This project includes a tutorial that explains a specific machine learning technique in detail, with accompanying code, visualizations, and references.

## Overview
This tutorial is focused on **[ Support Vector Machines (SVM)]**. It explains the technique's key concepts, demonstrates its implementation using Python, and provides guidance on how to apply it effectively in machine learning projects.

The tutorial is designed to help both beginners and advanced learners understand and utilize this technique. It includes:
- A detailed explanation of the technique.
- Python code implementation.
- Visualizations to explain the results.

## Contents
- **Tutorial:** [PDF Link or Web Page Link]
- **Code Files:** Implementation of the technique in Python (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
- **Resources:** Links to research papers, blogs, and other references used.
